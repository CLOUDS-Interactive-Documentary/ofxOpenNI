COMPILING AND CREATING THE BINARIES FOR ofxOpenni
----------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
=============
This repository compiles OpenNI and the PrimeSense/Sensor
module for the ofxOpenNI addon for the Mac. In the future this
will be used for the windows versions as well.

OpenNI uses dynamically loaded libraries which are loaded at
runtime. Your application which uses OpenNI need to have these
files. On Mac these are the "*.dylib" files. The Mac version
of ofxOpenNI, has a subdirectory caled "copy_to_data_path". The
contents of this directory should be copie dot your data path.
That's all. You don't need to install anything which makes your
application portable.

COMPILING OPENNI + SENSORKINECT FOR MAC
=======================================
If you just want to use the addon you can skip this part.

# get repositories
mkdir openni_dev
cd openni_dev
git clone git@github.com:roxlu/OpenNI.git
git clone git@github.com:roxlu/SensorKinect.git

# compile openNI
cd OpenNI/Platform/Mac/Bin/openFrameworks
./build.sh
make 
make install

# compile SensorKinect
cd SensorKinect/Platform/Mac/Bin/openFrameworks
./build.sh
make
make install

FIXING NITE LIBRARIES
=====================
Next thing you need to do is download the Nite binaries and extract it to
a directory called "nite" (same level as OpenNI and SensorKinect).
I assume you extracted the NITE-binary into the nite directory.

cp OpenNI/Platform/Mac/Bin/openFrameworks/nite* nite/
cd nite
./nite_copy_to_openframeworks.sh
./nite_change_rpaths


COPYING CREATED DYNAMIC LIBRARIES
=================================
Once you've followed the above steps, you'll have an newly
created directory called "OpenNI_openFrameworks/openni" which
contains all of the libraries you need to run openni on your
Mac (w/o installing anything else).
