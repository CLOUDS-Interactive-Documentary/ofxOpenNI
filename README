COMPILING AND CREATING THE BINARIES FOR ofxOpenni
----------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
=============
This repository compiles OpenNI and the PrimeSense/Sensor
module for the ofxOpenNI addon for the Mac. In the future this
will be used for the windows versions as well.

OpenNI uses dynamically loaded libraries which are loaded at
runtime. Your application which uses OpenNI need to have these
files. On Mac these are the "*.dylib" files. The Mac version
of ofxOpenNI, has a subdirectory caled "copy_to_data_path". The
contents of this directory should be copie dot your data path.
That's all. You don't need to install anything which makes your
application portable.

CREATING ofxOpenNI
==================
If you just want to use the addon you can skip this part.

mkdir openni_dev
cd openni_dev
git clone git@github.com:roxlu/OpenNI.git
git clone git@github.com:roxlu/SensorKinect.git
